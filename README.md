# 🔊 Voxa

Voxa is a **web-based conversational AI platform** built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
It’s designed to deliver **intelligent, context-aware, and engaging chat experiences** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **vector embeddings**, **Redis**, and **Upstash**.

This project was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- The page **auto-updates** as you make changes (hot reload).
- Voxa uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load and optimize fonts. The default font is **Inter**, giving the app a clean and modern look.
